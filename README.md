Simple chat for WLAN with speaking of received messages.
The desire for this program was to be able to communicate with another person when we both have access to a WLAN in a large area like inside of a cruise ship.  Both parties have Android tablets that would be set to receive a message from the other and then say the message to attract the recepient's attention.
It has two modes: Multicast and ServerSocket, incase the server does not support multicast.
